- Ability to enable collisions in multiplayer (Disables leaderboard uploads)
- Ability to hide chat in multiplayer
- Ability to disable the 60 seconds timeout in multiplayer
- Ability to change the length of time for the timeout in multiplayer
- Ability to disable the audio coming from other cars in multiplayer

KNOWN ISSUE:
When collisions are active the network cars are a little jittery when you're close to them. Not ideal, but it works fine.

The /canceltimeout command only works locally. It does not activate for everyone in the lobby.

I forgot to make the infinite killgrid not render for every car
