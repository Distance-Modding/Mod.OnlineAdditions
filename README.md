KNOWN ISSUE:

THINGS I WANT TO ADD BUT I DON'T HAVE TIME:
- A /restartme command that allows a player to restart themselves without leaving and rejoining.
- Server Host Events that allow the host to change the gameplay like turn on Monster Truck for everyone who has the mod in the server. This wouldn't be compatible to base game unfortunately, but it could make something like Monster Truck servers real or even let the host change car physics for players. (Would disable leaderboards of course)
- Prevent the issue where players get sent to lobby when a level is loading, or at least make the notify the player what went wrong.
- Porting server commands from the very old Spectrum server mod.
